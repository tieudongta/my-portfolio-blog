      <h2>Learning JavaScript Again: A Fresh Perspective</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on April 5, 2025</p>

      <p>Coming back to JavaScript after years away from active coding felt like returning to an old neighborhood — familiar in many ways, but full of surprises.</p>

      <h3>1. JavaScript Has Grown Up</h3>
      <p>When I first used JavaScript, we relied on jQuery and vanilla scripts tied directly to HTML. Now, with ES6+, modules, arrow functions, and async/await, the language feels more powerful and modern.</p>

      <h3>2. Frameworks Are Everywhere</h3>
      <p>React, Vue, Angular — the front-end landscape has exploded. I started with React to build components and found it intuitive once I adjusted to JSX. What surprised me most is how close these frameworks bring us to application-level engineering on the front end.</p>

      <h3>3. Debugging Got Better</h3>
      <p>The modern browser dev tools and VS Code extensions make debugging and experimentation much easier. I no longer fear the console; I embrace it.</p>

      <h3>4. Coding Feels More Collaborative Now</h3>
      <p>Open source projects, forums, and tutorials are more accessible than ever. I’ve started contributing small things and learning through feedback. It’s energizing to grow with a community.</p>

      <h3>5. My Past Experience Still Matters</h3>
      <p>Even though I’ve spent time in other industries, my experience managing developers and systems helps me think about code at a higher level — architecture, maintainability, team collaboration. These soft skills are more useful than I expected.</p>

      <p>Learning JavaScript again isn’t just about syntax — it’s about mindset. And I’m excited for what’s ahead.</p>
