      <p>When people see my resume, they often pause. “You went from managing software teams... to driving buses?” Yes — and I learned a lot from every turn.</p>

      <h3>Driving Taught Me Patience</h3>
      <p>Operating a bus in city traffic is no joke. You learn to stay calm, follow strict routes, and communicate with all kinds of people. It’s customer service, logistics, and discipline — all at once.</p>

      <h3>Building Taught Me Respect</h3>
      <p>Joining the Electrical Training Institute’s pre-apprenticeship program opened my eyes to the complexity of physical work. Measuring, bending, drilling — it all takes precision, planning, and teamwork. Construction taught me to slow down and pay attention to detail.</p>

      <h3>Software Still Feels Like Home</h3>
      <p>Despite all this, I kept feeling the pull of programming. I missed the creativity, the puzzles, the feeling of bringing something to life with code. That’s why I’ve returned to software, stronger than before and more motivated than ever.</p>

      <h3>There’s Power in a Nonlinear Path</h3>
      <p>Every job I’ve taken — bus driver, builder, developer — has shaped how I think and solve problems. And that diversity of experience? It’s not a weakness. It’s my biggest strength.</p>

      <p>If you’ve taken a winding path too, embrace it. You might just be collecting the best tools for the next chapter.</p>
