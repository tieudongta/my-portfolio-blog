      <h2>Building Mum's Tribute: A Journey of Code and Tears</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on May 06, 2025</p>
	  <p>When I decided to build a little tribute page for my mother, it began as a simple exercise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—just another portfolio piece to show prospective employers. But as I sifted through decades of photos, memories, and stories, something unexpected happened: the project stopped being “just code” and became a living tapestry of my childhood and her sacrifices.</p>
	<section>
		<h3>The First Line of Code</h3>
		<p>
            I’ll never forget the moment I typed my first &lt;header&gt; tag for her homage. A black-and-white portrait of her younger self appeared on my screen, and I felt a gentle tug at my heart. The next thing I knew, I was scrolling through folders of images—her baby photos, my feverish nights, the bicycle rides through rice paddies—each click pulling me deeper into nostalgia.
        </p>
    <section>
        <h3>Emotion in Every Section</h3>
		<p>
            Writing the “About” section, I paused over her professional summary—her certifications, her perseverance, her unwavering love. I thought I knew her story, but the act of setting it in stone on a web page made me see her anew. Then came the memories: the sweaty night I burned with fever, the day she shouted at me in anger, the train journeys through the dark—all rendered in plain paragraphs of text, yet alive with fresh tears.
        </p>

        <h3>Typing and Crying</h3>
        <p>By the time I crafted the “Stories” section, my fingers were wet. I’d read my own words back to myself—“She stayed awake so we wouldn’t be stepped on by strangers”—and the floodgates opened. I cried as I typed, pausing the code editor to wipe my eyes, then returning to write more. The smooth fade transitions I’d added to the slideshow suddenly felt symbolic of memory itself—each image fading in, each chapter of her life shimmering back into view.</p>
    </section>

        <h3>Realizing What I’d Lost</h3>
        <p>Only when I embedded her favorite song, Giọt Mưa Thu, did I fully grasp how much I’d missed her voice. I remembered her humming that melody on quiet afternoons. In that moment, I wasn’t practicing JavaScript—I was reaching out to her, across time and absence, through every line of code.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Beyond a Portfolio Piece</h3>
        <p>What started as “just a project” evolved into a pilgrimage of the heart. I realized that true web development for me isn’t only about frameworks or deployment; it’s about using technology to preserve memory, to honor those who taught us how to love and endure.</p>
    </section>
	<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
	<p>My mother may no longer be here to click through the pages I built, but in every smooth scroll, every captioned photo, every softly looping song, she lives on. And as I continue to refine my skills, I carry her legacy forward—one tag, one style rule, one tear at a time.</p>
     <p>Thanks for reading. Good luck, and enjoy the journey!</p>
