      <h2>Why I Left Tech — And Why I’m Coming Back</h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on April 20, 2025</p>

      <p>For nearly a decade, I lived and breathed software. As a project manager at FPT Software, I led teams, met deadlines, and delivered solutions to clients across the globe. I loved solving problems. But eventually, something was missing. I craved a different kind of challenge — something more physical, more tangible.</p>

      <p>So I made a bold decision: I left the tech industry and became a bus driver. Later, I entered a pre-apprenticeship program in the skilled trades through the Electrical Training Institute. It might sound like a strange leap, but it was one of the most eye-opening experiences of my life.</p>

      <h3>What I Learned on the Job Site</h3>
      <p>In construction, everything is about precision and safety. You don’t just "deploy and fix later" — a mistake can hurt someone. I learned to respect tools, follow processes, and work in teams where trust is everything. These are lessons I’ll carry with me into my next chapter in tech.</p>

      <h3>Why I’m Returning to Software</h3>
      <p>Even while I was in the field, I found myself tinkering with code at night. I missed creating. I missed solving abstract problems. And I realized: I didn’t need to choose between the worlds I loved. My goal now is to combine my technical knowledge, field experience, and leadership skills to build tools that matter — tools that serve real people.</p>

      <p>I'm currently rebuilding my development portfolio, learning modern web technologies again, and excited to contribute to software teams that value curiosity, resilience, and real-world perspective.</p>

      <p>Thanks for reading. If you're someone who's changed paths — or thinking about it — I’d love to hear your story, too.</p>
