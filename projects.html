						<h3> Dump Truck Cleanup App </h3>
						<p>A Unity C# game where players drive a dump truck through a dynamic city environment to collect trash and complete cleanup missions. I designed and programmed core gameplay systems including vehicle controls, trash collection mechanics, mission logic, and UI flow. The game demonstrates my skills in object-oriented programming, physics-based interactions, scene management, and optimization within Unity.</p>

Features include a “Flower of the Day,” personalized flower recommendations based on birthdate, interactive mini-games, and knowledge quizzes. This project showcases my front-end development skills, API integration, dynamic content rendering, and user-focused UI/UX design.</p>

						<h3>Vocab Fun App </h3>
						<p>A React-based web application designed to help users build English vocabulary through immersive reading and listening experiences. It integrates free resources from Project Gutenberg and LibriVox to provide access to public domain books with synchronized audio narration. Users can read along with real voice recordings, learn word meanings in context, and reinforce their vocabulary through interactive games. This project highlights my expertise in React, asynchronous data handling, third-party API integration, and building engaging educational tools.
