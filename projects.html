							<h3> Mother Tribute Page</h3>
						<p>This project is a deeply personal tribute web page created in memory of my mother. Designed with emotional intent and cultural sensitivity, the page features bilingual content (Vietnamese and English), elegant typography, and a soft, respectful layout. I used HTML, CSS, and custom font integration (including a handwriting-style font for emotional tone) to craft a design that balances beauty and simplicity. The project demonstrates my skills in responsive design, font handling, and cultural UI/UX considerations.</p>

						<h3>Vocab Fun App </h3>

This project highlights my expertise in React, asynchronous data handling, third-party API integration, and building engaging educational tools.
