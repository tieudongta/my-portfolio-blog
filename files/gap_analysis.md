âœ… Your Strengths
ðŸ§  Technical Proficiency
Languages & Frameworks: You already know JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, React, and Angular â€” which are front-end essentials.

Backend & Full-Stack: Experience with C#, PHP, Python, RESTful APIs, and databases (SQL, MongoDB) positions you well for full-stack roles.

DevOps & Tools: Git, Jenkins, Docker, AWS â€” excellent modern tooling.

Software Design: Solid foundation in OOP, MVC, and algorithms.

Certifications: Your PMP certification and project leadership experience set you apart from most devs.

ðŸ’¼ Professional Experience
Youâ€™ve led teams, managed clients, and delivered complex software â€” many junior/mid-level developers don't have that.

International and multilingual experience is a bonus for global or remote teams.

Youâ€™ve worked across sectors (IT, transportation, construction), which shows adaptability.

ðŸ“‰ Skill Gaps & Development Areas (Compared to Web Dev Job Market)
Category	Gap/Need	Suggested Action
Recent Web Dev Practice	Your last web development role was in 2015. Recent hands-on work with modern web stacks (React, Vue, Tailwind) will boost your relevance.	Build or contribute to personal projects with modern stacks (React + Tailwind + Vite + Node).
Responsive Design/UI Trends	UI/UX design is listed, but specific tools/skills like Figma, accessibility (WCAG), or mobile-first design aren't mentioned.	Study or replicate UIs from Dribbble/Figma, focus on responsive/mobile-first layouts.
Frontend Testing	No mention of frontend testing tools like Jest, React Testing Library, or Cypress.	Learn basic unit testing for React apps. Itâ€™s now expected in many roles.
Portfolio & GitHub Presence	No link or mention. Recruiters expect to see code samples, live demos, or a personal portfolio site.	Build a portfolio with 2â€“3 deployed projects + README + clean repo.
vCard / QR / HTML5 features	If targeting jobs like digital business cards or interactive UIs, using Canvas, Web APIs, or QR code generation is a nice plus.	Expand the business card project with download, animations, or cloud-hosted contact forms.
Certifications (Web-specific)	PMP is great, but for web-specific roles, something like freeCodeCamp, Meta Front-End, or Google UX Design can reinforce your skill.	Pick 1â€“2 certificates that reinforce your frontend or UI development track.
Soft Skill Reframing	You've done project leadership, but not framed from a developer collaboration or Agile team member POV.	Rephrase resume points to show collaboration, PRs, Agile ceremonies, or code review participation.
